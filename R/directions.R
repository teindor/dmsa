## THE BUNDLED DIRECTION MAPS
##
## DMSA cannot align anything without knowing, per probe, whether higher
## methylation raises or lowers the expression of the gene it belongs to.
## Requiring every user to obtain that map from a separate package before
## they can run anything is the single largest barrier between "I have a
## normalised matrix" and "I have a DMSA result", so usable maps ship here.
##
## WHAT IS BUNDLED, AND WHAT IS NOT. Two layers of cpgdirection ship: blood
## and nasal epithelium, each restricted to the rows that carry an actual
## call. Roughly seven in ten rows of the full table are ABSTAIN - the model
## declined to commit - and an abstention is not a direction, so it cannot be
## aligned to and is not shipped. That restriction is why 18 MB becomes under
## 3 MB with no loss of anything DMSA could have used.
##
## WHY TWO LAYERS AND NOT ONE. Direction is tissue-specific, and the array
## studies that will use this package are not one tissue. Whole blood is the
## externally validated layer and the right proxy for an immune-dominated
## sample: adult saliva by passive drool runs about 82% immune, so blood calls
## are the correct calls there. Neonatal and infant buccal swabs are the
## opposite - .89 to 1.00 epithelial - and applying immune-derived calls to a
## near-pure epithelial sample would align every probe against the wrong
## tissue while reporting full coverage. Shipping blood alone would have made
## that silent. Nasal epithelium is the epithelial proxy.
##
## The brain bridge, the SMR causal layer, the remaining tissues and the full
## 3.1M-pair table stay in cpgdirection, which remains the complete resource.
##
## VERSIONING. Annotation drift silently changes enrichment results, and a
## direction map is an annotation. A DMSA finding that moved because the map
## moved would be the same failure this package exists to name. So each map
## carries a version, and every alignment records which version produced it.

#' The direction calls DMSA ships with
#'
#' Returns per-probe methylation-to-expression direction calls from the maps
#' bundled with dmsa, so an alignment can be built without obtaining a
#' direction resource separately.
#'
#' Two layers of \code{cpgdirection} are bundled, each restricted to the
#' probe-gene pairs that carry an actual call. About seven in ten rows of the
#' full table abstain, and an abstention cannot be aligned to, so those rows
#' are not shipped - which is why the reduction costs nothing DMSA could have
#' used.
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{"blood"}}{Whole blood: 488,204 pairs over 237,761 probes and
#'     5,376 genes. The externally validated layer, and the right calls for an
#'     immune-dominated sample - adult saliva by passive drool runs about 82%
#'     immune.}
#'   \item{\code{"epithelium"}}{Nasal epithelium: 688,843 pairs over 277,830
#'     probes and 4,447 genes. The right calls for an epithelium-dominated
#'     sample - neonatal and infant buccal swabs run .89 to 1.00 epithelial,
#'     where blood calls would be the wrong tissue.}
#' }
#'
#' Choose the layer by what the sample is made of, not by what it is called.
#' The failure mode this guards against is quiet: an epithelial sample scored
#' against immune-derived calls reports full coverage while every direction is
#' drawn from the wrong tissue.
#'
#' The brain bridge, the SMR causal layer, the remaining tissues and the full
#' 3.1M-pair table live in \code{cpgdirection}
#' (\doi{10.5281/zenodo.22024185}), which remains the complete resource.
#'
#' A probe may map to more than one gene - a median of two, up to seven - and
#' every mapped pair is returned, because which gene a probe is read against
#' is a modelling decision rather than a lookup.
#'
#' @param probes Character vector of CpG identifiers. \code{NULL} (default)
#'   returns the whole map.
#' @param genes Optional character vector restricting the result. Either one
#'   gene per entry of \code{probes}, selecting those specific pairs, or a
#'   shorter vector naming genes to keep.
#' @param tissue Which bundled layer: \code{"blood"} (default) or
#'   \code{"epithelium"}. See Details for how to choose.
#' @return A \code{data.frame} with \code{probe}, \code{gene}, \code{d}
#'   (\code{-1} or \code{+1}), \code{p_plus} (the probability the direction is
#'   \code{+1}) and \code{tier} (evidence grade). The map's provenance and
#'   version are attached as the \code{"dmsa_direction_map"} attribute.
