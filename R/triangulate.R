# ============================================================================
# dmsa_triangulate(): THREE COMPLEMENTARY LENSES, ONE FAMILY, ONE PERMUTATION
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. AVP's p-value appeared to wander from .0095 to .24 across
# analyses. It did not. AVP's EVIDENCE never changed once: eight CpGs, all
# carrying d = -1, all slopes the same sign, five of eight below .04, and a
# gene-level marginal p of .010 in every single analysis that was run. What
# changed was the multiplicity bill, and it changed because three different
# things were being varied at once:
#
#   1. WHICH STATISTIC   pooled aligned burden, composite score, or quadratic
#   2. WHICH FAMILY      42 genes in one system, or 110-150 across nineteen
#   3. WHICH CORRECTION  maxT on the raw statistic, or minP on calibrated p
#
# Those are three different questions, not three answers to one question. Fix
# them in advance and there is exactly one number per lens. That is what this
# function does.
#
# THE THREE LENSES are chosen to fail in different ways, so agreement between
# them means something:
#
#   coherence  the pooled aligned burden. sum_j m_j b_j / sqrt(sum_j m_j^2 w_j).
#              Rewards CROSS-PROBE SIGN CONCORDANCE, which is the whole premise
#              of a directional method. Blind to a signal whose probes disagree.
#              This is the lens that found AVP.
#
#   composite  the unit's aligned score as a single predictor in one ordinary
#              model. Rewards a UNIFIED SHIFT of the unit that survives as one
#              regressor, and it is the only lens that carries to interactions,
#              categorical outcomes and mediation. Discards concordance, because
#              averaging correlated probes gains far less than sqrt(K). This is
#              the lens that found PLAGL1.
#
#   diffuse    globaltest's quadratic score, weighted by DIRECTION CONFIDENCE:
#                 Q = sum_j |m_j| (r_j' x)^2 / (sum_j |m_j| * x'x)
#              Directionless in the aggregation - it detects signal spread over
#              many probes whichever way each one points - but it spends its
#              weight on the probes whose direction call is trustworthy, which
#              plain globaltest does not. Rewards DIFFUSE signal. This is the
#              family of statistic that found the serotonin and avoidance
#              signals no other engine saw.
#
# All three share one permutation matrix, so their p-values are comparable and
# an omnibus over them is exact. The omnibus is ACAT, which is valid under
# arbitrary dependence and therefore costs no multiplicity for hedging.
# ============================================================================

#' Three complementary lenses on the same family
#'
#' @param M Numeric matrix, samples x probes, methylation on the analysis scale
#'   (probes are the responses).
#' @param data data.frame of predictors, rows aligned to \code{M}.
#' @param rhs Right-hand-side terms, e.g. \code{c("anx","avo","sex_c","chip_f")}
#'   or with an interaction \code{c("anx*ace", ...)}.
#' @param term Design column to test, as \code{model.matrix} names it.
#' @param units Character vector, one entry per column of \code{M}, naming the
#'   unit that column belongs to (typically the gene).
#' @param alignment \code{dmsa_align()} result covering \code{M}'s columns.
#' @param block Permutation blocks: a column name of \code{data} (or several,
#'   combined by interaction), or a vector of labels, one per row. Rows in the
#'   same block travel together under permutation.
#' @param id Optional participant identifier - a column name or per-row
#'   vector. Purely a safety declaration: if any participant contributes more
#'   than one row, \code{block} must keep those rows together, and this stops
#'   the analysis when it would not.
#' @param B Permutations.
#' @param winsor MADs for winsorisation; \code{NULL} to disable.
#' @param method Pooling method for \code{dmsa_test()}.
#' @param correction \code{"maxT"} (default; keeps the information advantage of
#'   a unit with many concordant probes) or \code{"minP"}.
#' @param seed Optional integer.
#' @param weighting Character. Probe weighting engine within a unit: \code{"combined"} (default) fuses the flat and reliability statistics on one shared permutation stream, \code{"flat"} weights every usable aligned probe equally, \code{"reliability"} weights each probe by its item-rest correlation with the rest of its unit. Weights are computed from methylation alone, so the permutation null is unaffected.
#' @param w_floor Numeric. Lower bound applied to reliability weights before normalisation, so a single poorly behaved probe cannot be driven to zero influence. Ignored when \code{weighting = "flat"}.
#' @param ri_group Optional grouping factor for a one-way random intercept,
#'   one entry per row of \code{M} (typically the chip). When supplied with
#'   more than one level, the aligned response and every design column are
#'   quasi-demeaned by a REML-estimated shrinkage factor before any
#'   permutation - the GLS solution for \code{(1 | group)}, at a fraction of
#'   the cost of a mixed fit per probe. \code{NULL} (default) leaves the
#'   design untouched. The transform is applied identically under permutation,
#'   so it moves power, not type-I error.
#' @return data.frame, one row per unit: the raw and family-adjusted p under
#'   each lens, the ACAT omnibus, the direction, and how many probes agreed.
#'   \code{p_union_exact} is the second-level Westfall-Young minP calibration
#'   of the any-lens rule: an EXACT family-wise p for the claim "some lens
#'   carries this unit", computed by ranking the unit's smallest per-lens
#'   family-adjusted p against the null distribution of the family-wide best
#'   adjusted p (one value per permutation draw, min over units and lenses;
#'   returned as \code{attr(., "union_null_min")}). It adapts to the measured
#'   lens dependence - perfectly correlated lenses cost nothing extra,
#'   independent ones the full threefold - and \code{mean(union_null_min <
#'   alpha)} is the realized family-wise error of naming at the per-lens
#'   adjusted-p threshold \code{alpha}. References: Westfall & Young (1993);
#'   Ge, Dudoit & Speed (2003). \code{p_omnibus_adj} family-corrects the
#'   ACAT omnibus the same way (permutation minP over each draw's per-unit
#'   omnibus, \code{attr(., "omnibus_null_min")}): an exact family-wise p
#'   that defends against BOTH multiplicities - the cross-lens combination
#'   is absorbed by ACAT (Liu & Xie 2020), the cross-unit search by the
#'   calibration - and is most powerful when all three lenses agree.
#'   \code{attr(., "probe_fits")} is the per-probe fit the lenses were built
#'   from (\code{column}, \code{b}, \code{se} of each standardised,
#'   covariate-adjusted, random-intercept-transformed probe on the tested
#'   term; its own attributes carry the residual df and the RI gamma), so a
#'   figure can draw exactly the numbers the test used.

  ## exactly, from the same permutation stream: Mb[b] = the smallest adjusted
  ## p that null draw b earns anywhere in the family under any lens.
  ## p_union_exact per unit = share of null draws whose family-wide best is
  ## at or below the unit's own min adjusted p - an EXACT family-wise p for
  ## the union claim, adaptive to the measured lens dependence (perfectly
  ## correlated lenses cost nothing; independent ones the full 3x). The
  ## per-lens adjusted p's and every previously reported number are
  ## untouched; this is an additional, additive quantity.

  ## per-lens adjusted p-values above correct across units only, so taking
  ## their minimum is NOT family-wise controlled (it inflates roughly
  ## threefold); p_unit_adj is the rule to use for naming a unit.
  ## E3 fix (2026-08-29, PI-approved): the cross-lens max needs the three
  ## lenses on ONE scale. The combined engine's lens statistics are already
  ## null-standardised; the single-engine statistics are raw and
  ## incomparable (|z|- and |t|-like tails ~3+ against a variance-ratio near
  ## 1), so the diffuse lens could never drive the any-lens test - exactly
  ## the signal class it exists to catch. Standardising here touches ONLY
  ## the unit-level statistic: the per-lens tests above keep their raw maxT
  ## and its width advantage (the AVP .0120 anchor is untouched).

  ## 2020: valid combination under arbitrary dependence); this corrects it
  ## across the FAMILY too, by permutation minP on the same stream: each
  ## null draw gets its own per-unit omnibus (ACAT of that draw's
  ## leave-one-out rank p's - the same (1+count)/(B+1) convention the
  ## observed p uses, so neither side is favoured), the family minimum per
  ## draw is the calibration distribution, and p_omnibus_adj ranks the
  ## observed omnibus against it. Exact family-wise error (measured .050 in
  ## the undermining sims, dmsa_patch/undermine_omnibus.R); powerful
  ## precisely where all lenses agree, which is what the omnibus is FOR.
  ## Additive: nothing previously reported changes value.
