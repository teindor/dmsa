##   MEASUREMENT AVAILABILITY   the user's actual CpGs      (their data)
##   TARGET DISCOVERY+DIRECTION cpgdirection::cpg_gene_pairs()
##   ANALYTICAL OBJECT          measurement x cpg_id x target_gene
##
## DMSA never pre-selects CpGs. It reads whatever methylation the user
## supplies, canonicalises each measurement to a CpG id, and asks cpgdirection
## which genes that CpG supports and in which direction - separately for every
## CpG x gene pair. The selected genes are a FILTER over that discovery, never
## a requirement and never an expander: a direction resource may not add a
## biological gene the user did not select (spec 25).
##
## ONE CpG MAPS TO MANY GENES. That is the biology, not a duplicate to clean
## up: cg25140571 supports CAV3, HSA-MIR-548BA, OXTR and TRIM66, and only the
## OXTR pair carries a usable direction. Deduplicating by cpg_id or by data
## column destroys exactly the co-effects the analysis is built on, so the
## uniqueness key here is the PAIR, never the CpG (spec 11, 18).
##
## Co-effects (one CpG -> many genes) and technical replicates (many probe
## designs -> one CpG) are DIFFERENT problems and are never solved by one
## duplicated() call (spec 20).

## Canonical CpG id from a user's measurement column.
## EPIC v2 columns arrive as cg########_<design>_<time>_<GENE>, e.g.
## "cg00645497_BC21_T1_CD38". The CpG is the leading cg id; the trailing gene
## is INPUT PROVENANCE only - it never restricts the CpG to that gene, because
## cpgdirection's augment mode can legitimately return further targets
## (spec 10).

## only. EPIC v2 also ships variant probes (nv-GRCh38-chr19-...-A-C_TC11_T1_GNA11,

##                   under "keep_correlated" the exact user data column.

##   "collapse_site"    [default] several probe designs of ONE CpG are one
##                      measurement; the replicates are averaged before
##                      analysis, because they are repeated reads of the same
##                      site and counting them separately inflates that site.
##   "keep_correlated"  keep every design as its own measurement and accept
##                      that they are correlated.

## The cpgdirection adapter (spec 6, 7).
##
## `pairs` is the INJECTION SEAM. Production passes NULL and the real
## cpgdirection::cpg_gene_pairs() is resolved at call time; tests pass a
## fixture table so the architecture is exercised in builds where cpgdirection
## is not installed - the alternative, skip_if_not_installed(), would hide the
## core of the package from its own build report.
##
## Resolution is by name rather than `::` on purpose: cpgdirection ships from
## GitHub/Zenodo, and Bioconductor forbids declaring a dependency its build
## system cannot install.
##
## THE SWITCH, when cpgdirection is accepted into Bioconductor:
##   1. DESCRIPTION:  Imports: ..., cpgdirection
##   2. NAMESPACE:    importFrom(cpgdirection, cpg_gene_pairs)
##   3. here:         replace the .cpgd("cpg_gene_pairs") lookup and its
##                    is.null() guard with a direct cpg_gene_pairs(...) call.
## Nothing else in DMSA changes, because nothing else calls cpgdirection.
##
## DMSA depends on cpgdirection, NOT on cpgdirectionData. The planned layout is
##   cpgdirectionData  ExperimentHub package holding the large layers
##   cpgdirection      thin software package; retrieves them from the Hub
##   dmsa              Imports cpgdirection
## so the data package is cpgdirection's dependency to declare, not DMSA's.
## Wiring DMSA straight to cpgdirectionData would bypass the direction ladder
## that resolves a pair, which is the whole reason cpgdirection exists.

## Alpha's child file, "_maternal" and "_paternal" mark the parents' probes
## and the child's carry no group tag. Which group a question is about is a
## SELECTION, and it must be one line, not a hand-built column vector.

#' Select CpG measurement columns by name pattern
#'
#' Returns the CpG-site column names of \code{x} that survive an
#' include/exclude filter on the NAMES. Patterns are fixed substrings
#' (not regular expressions), matched case-sensitively; a column survives
#' \code{include} if it contains ANY of the include patterns, and is then
#' removed by \code{exclude} if it contains ANY of the exclude patterns.
#' Only CpG-site columns (names starting \code{cg...}) are considered -
#' outcomes and covariates are never touched. The same filter is available
#' directly inside \code{dmsa_frame()} as \code{cpgs_include} /
#' \code{cpgs_exclude}.
#'
#' @param x A data.frame, a matrix, or a character vector of column names.
#' @param include Optional character vector of fixed substrings; keep only
#'   CpG columns containing at least one. \code{NULL} keeps all.
#' @param exclude Optional character vector of fixed substrings; drop CpG
#'   columns containing at least one. Applied after \code{include}.
#' @return Character vector of surviving CpG column names.
