## THE P-DANCE TEST
##
## A finding is a claim about a unit. If the unit's p-value moves when the
## analyst changes which OTHER probes are in the analysis - probes that carry
## none of the unit's evidence - then the number was never a property of the
## finding alone, and no two laboratories will reproduce it, because no two
## laboratories load the same probe set. Detection-p QC, artifact masks and
## the 450K/EPIC transition put cross-cohort divergence at a few per cent to
## a few tens of per cent by construction.
##
## The test perturbs the analysis set in one of two directions while holding
## the focal unit's own probes fixed, and reports what each engine's p-value
## does. It is engine-agnostic on purpose: an engine here is any function
## from a set of probes to a p-value, so a competitor is tested by exactly
## the procedure that tests DMSA.

#' The p-dance test: does a finding's p-value survive a change of analysis set?
#'
#' Perturbs the analysis set around a fixed finding and records what happens to
#' each engine's p-value. The focal unit's own probes are never touched, so any
#' movement is attributable to the analysis set rather than to the evidence.
#'
#' Two forms, both reported in the same way:
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{"dropout"}}{Removes a random fraction of the non-focal probes.
#'     The omitted probes carry no focal evidence, so a finding that depends on
#'     them was never about its own unit.}
#'   \item{\code{"addition"}}{Adds probes drawn from \code{pool}, which sits
#'     outside the analysis set. This is the direction a competitive engine is
#'     most sensitive to, because added probes enter its background.}
#' }
#'
#' The two forms move competitive and whole-set engines in opposite directions,
#' which is why running only one of them understates the problem.
#'
#' @param engines Named list of functions. Each takes one argument - the
#'   members of a perturbed analysis set, in whatever form \code{set} is given
#'   - and returns a single p-value. Anything expressible this way can be
#'   tested, which is the point: DMSA and its competitors are put through an
#'   identical procedure.
#' @param set The full analysis set: a character vector of probe identifiers or
#'   an integer vector of column indices.
#' @param focal The focal unit's own members, a subset of \code{set}. Never
#'   perturbed. These carry the evidence the finding is about.
#' @param pool For \code{form = "addition"}, the reservoir of probes to add,
#'   disjoint from \code{set}. Ignored for dropout.
#' @param form \code{"dropout"} (default) or \code{"addition"}.
#' @param grid Perturbation sizes. For dropout, fractions of the non-focal
#'   probes to remove; defaults to \code{c(.01, .02, .03, .05, .10, .20, .30,
#'   .50)}, which spans the observed range of cross-cohort probe-set divergence
#'   and then some. For addition, counts of probes to add; defaults to
#'   \code{c(1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50)}.
#' @param R Replicates per grid point. Default 100. The reported quantity is a
#'   spread, so this is the resolution of the answer.
#' @param alpha Significance threshold used only to report whether a replicate's
#'   verdict differs from the unperturbed one. Default 0.05.
#' @param seed Optional integer for reproducibility. The caller's RNG state is
#'   restored on exit.
#' @return A \code{data.frame} with one row per engine, grid point and
#'   replicate: \code{engine}, \code{form}, \code{size} (the fraction dropped or
#'   the count added), \code{rep}, \code{p}, and \code{flip} - whether that
#'   replicate's verdict at \code{alpha} differs from the unperturbed verdict.
#'   The unperturbed run is included as \code{size = 0}, \code{rep = 0}. The
#'   baseline p-value per engine is attached as the \code{"baseline"} attribute.
