# dmsa — Directional Methylation Set Analysis

**DMSA asks a directional question of a set of CpG probes: does this
gene’s — or this biological system’s — methylation move in the direction
that raises or lowers its expression?** It then names the gene
responsible while paying the multiplicity toll, and it computes each
unit’s answer from that unit’s own probes alone.

That last property is not incidental. Most set-based methylation engines
compute a unit’s p-value partly from the other probes the analyst
happened to load, so the same finding moves when the analysis set
changes — a failure mode we name and measure as **p-dancing**. DMSA’s
unit statistics are invariant to it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What DMSA does

Directional Methylation Set Analysis (DMSA) is an R package for gene-set
and system-level analysis of DNA methylation array data. Before
aggregating, DMSA aligns each probe’s effect to that probe’s predicted
consequence for gene expression, so probes predicted to raise expression
and probes predicted to lower it are no longer averaged against each
other. Each unit’s statistic is computed from that unit’s own probes
alone, and multiplicity is corrected only within level-local families.
In a benchmark where opposing effects cancelled under conventional
aggregation, DMSA reached 84% power against 7-8% for camera, fry and
over-representation alternatives, and reported the correct biological
direction in 100% of its detections. Where the question was instead
whether a whole panel was associated, DMSA’s pooled score stayed silent
while globaltest correctly rejected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why alignment matters

A CpG in a promoter and a CpG in a gene body carry opposite expression
consequences for the same change in methylation. Averaging them discards
the signal. At a 50/50 promoter/body composition the methylation-scale
mean cancels exactly, and every direction-blind engine is null **by
construction** rather than by weakness.

DMSA aligns each probe to its predicted expression consequence before
aggregating:

    m_j  =  d_j  ×  w_g  ×  (2 p₊ − 1)

where `d_j ∈ {−1, +1}` is the probe’s methylation-to-expression
direction, `w_g` the gene’s curated polarity with respect to its
system’s activation tone, and `p₊` the confidence in the direction call.

In the locked benchmark, DMSA holds power .83–.86 flat across the
empirically reported promoter/body range while direction-blind
competitors track the ratio and bottom out at the nominal rate; DMSA
reports the correct expression-scale direction in 100% of its detections
at every ratio.

## Installation

``` r

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("teindor/dmsa")
```

To install the exact version used for every number in the manuscript:

``` r

remotes::install_github("teindor/dmsa@v1.20.2")
```

Or from the archived tarball on Zenodo:

``` r

install.packages("dmsa_1.20.2.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

Everything DMSA needs is base R plus `stats` and `data.table`. Direction
calls (`d`, `p_plus`) can come from any table with those columns; the
companion package
[`cpgdirection`](https://github.com/teindor/cpgdirection)
([10.5281/zenodo.22024185](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22024185))
supplies them for 3.1 million CpG-gene pairs and is optional. `gt`,
`lme4`, `lmerTest`, `MASS`, `nnet` and the `Gviz` stack are optional and
used only where noted.

Start with
[`vignette("dmsa")`](https://teindor.github.io/dmsa/articles/dmsa.md) —
a complete worked analysis in which a direction-blind test reads null
and DMSA recovers the signal from the same data.

## The two-call interface

Declare the design once, then run it.

``` r

library(dmsa)

frame <- dmsa_frame(
  data      = dat,                       # participants × (outcomes, covariates)
  M         = meth,                      # participants × probes
  systems   = c("hpa", "oxytocin"),      # short names; see dmsa_systems()
  module    = TRUE,                      # system > module > gene > probe
  outcome   = "attachment_anxiety",
  covariates = "contract",               # sex, age, cell fractions, ctrlSVs, chip
  B         = 1999
)

frame                                    # prints the design + every autofix applied
res <- dmsa_report(frame)                # figures, tables, summary.md under outdir
```

### The selection set

`systems =` takes short names from the bundled selection set — the
curated `system > module > gene > probe` cascade that declares which
probes form which unit. **Everything below the chosen system defaults to
full**: `"hpa"` takes all 8 modules, 49 genes and 538 CpGs the set
assigns to the HPA axis.

``` r

dmsa_systems()                                  # 30 systems and their short names
dmsa_select(systems = c("hpa", "oxytocin"))     # inspect before running
dmsa_select(systems = "hpa", modules = "2.6")   # narrow a level if you must
```

Short names, ids, full names and unique prefixes all resolve; ambiguity
errors rather than guesses. Bringing your own panel is a CSV in the same
shape —
[`dmsa_sets_template()`](https://teindor.github.io/dmsa/reference/dmsa_sets_template.md)
writes the schema,
[`dmsa_sets_check()`](https://teindor.github.io/dmsa/reference/dmsa_sets_check.md)
validates it,
[`dmsa_sets()`](https://teindor.github.io/dmsa/reference/dmsa_sets.md)
loads it. Full instructions in
[`SELECTION_SETS.md`](https://teindor.github.io/dmsa/SELECTION_SETS.md).

Module labels in the bundled set are literature-audited, and the audit
travels with the result:
[`dmsa_evidence()`](https://teindor.github.io/dmsa/reference/dmsa_evidence.md)
gives the evidence tier, the membership flags and the citation keys
behind each module, and the counts print with the frame and in
`summary.md`. A module-level finding is only as good as the module’s
definition, so the definition’s evidence is reported next to it.

``` r

dmsa_evidence(frame, which = "flagged")
```

### The test drive

[`dmsa_frame()`](https://teindor.github.io/dmsa/reference/dmsa_frame.md)
runs a full test drive before anything else: numeric coercion with a
per-column loss report, a QR rank audit that drops aliased columns **by
name**, a block audit with equal-size permutation strata, a hard error
when fewer than ~2¹⁰ distinct permutations exist, and a B = 49 pilot
with a printed ETA. Every action lands in `frame$corrections` and is
repeated in the report.

### Three lenses, one permutation stream

Each unit is tested three ways on a single shared permutation stream:

| lens | what it rewards |
|----|----|
| **coherence** | cross-probe sign agreement — a gene whose probes all point one way |
| **composite** | a block shift detected by the averaging statistic |
| **diffuse** | a confidence-weighted quadratic, thin signal spread across many probes |

An ACAT omnibus combines them. The three are three views of one problem,
and a hit along one path is the architecture, not a loophole.

### Level-local families

Correction happens **inside** level-local families — systems, then the
genes of a named system, then the probes of a surviving gene — by maxT
with step-down. This is what lets DMSA name a member without the toll
that a flat correction across every gene in the panel would impose.

### Weighting engines

``` r

dmsa_triangulate(..., weighting = "combined")   # default
dmsa_triangulate(..., weighting = "flat")       # exact reproducibility reference
dmsa_triangulate(..., weighting = "reliability")
```

`reliability` weights each aligned probe by its item-rest correlation
with the rest of its unit, computed from **methylation alone** so the
permutation null stays exact and weighting changes power rather than
type-I error. `combined` fuses flat and reliability on one shared
permutation stream, standardising each statistic by its own permutation
null before combination. `flat` is the original equal-weight engine and
reproduces the published anchors exactly.

**Which to use.** `combined` is the default because the shape of a real
signal is not known in advance: on real cohort data neither flat nor
reliability dominated — reliability gained on concentrated single-gene
signals and lost on diffuse system-level ones — so hedging keeps every
finding. That insurance is not free. In simulation, where the signal
shape *is* known, flat weighting needs fewer participants than combined
in every cell tested: 326 against 337 for a twelve-gene family, 472
against 764 for a three-system family. If you have reason to believe
your signal is coherent, `weighting = "flat"` will find it with a
smaller sample. If you don’t, pay the premium.
